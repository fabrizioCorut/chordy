%% Function: handover/3
%% Purpose: Splits the Key-Value Storage and ReplicatedStorage based on Id and NewPredecessorKey and sends the NewPredecessor his Key-Values.
%% Args:    Id - Should uniquely identify the process. Used for debugging purposes.
%%          Storage - Holds the key-value pairs that this Node is managing.
%%          ReplicatedStorage - Holds the key-value pairs that we have replicated from our Predecessor.
%%          NewPredecessor - Our new Predecessor. The Node that preceedes us in the Chord ring.
%% Returns: Updated Storage, without the values that our NewPredecessor now manages.

%% Function: create_probe/2
%% Purpose: Starts sending a probe message to our Successor.

%% Purpose: Ends the probing message since the probe that we started has been send back to us.
%%          Prints debug information about the ring: time it took to walk and the Nodes that we went through.
%% Args:    Time - Start time of the probing.

%% Purpose: Forwards the probe to our Successor. Appends us as a Node to the list of Nodes.
%% Args:    Ref - Unique identifier of the Node that started the probe.
%%          Nodes - Nodes that the probe has went through since it has started.
%%          Time - Time, in the system of the Node that requested the probing, when the probing has started.
%%          Id - Should uniquely identify the process. Used for debugging purposes.
